# 📦 **Back End Development and APIs**

This repository contains all my completed projects from the **FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs Certification**.

Through this journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose** to build **microservice APIs** and full-stack capabilities using JavaScript on the server side.

---

## 🛠️ **Skills & Tools Practiced**
- **Node.js** runtime and built-in modules  
- **Express.js** framework for building web servers  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing documents  
- **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB schema and data management  
- Managing dependencies with **npm**  
- Working with **RESTful APIs** and HTTP methods

## ✅ **Completed Projects**

### 1. 📅 **Timestamp Microservice**
A simple API that returns the current **UNIX timestamp** and **UTC date** in JSON format.

### 2. 📡 **Request Header Parser**
Parses browser header info (**IP address, language, software**) from incoming requests.

### 3. 🔗 **URL Shortener**
Shortens long URLs and **redirects users** via short slugs.

### 4. 🏃‍♂️ **Exercise Tracker**
A full-stack API to **track users and their exercise logs** using MongoDB.

### 5. 📂 **File Metadata Microservice**
Accepts **file uploads** and returns metadata (**file name, type, size**) about them.

## 🎯 **Goal of This Repository**
This repository was created as part of my mission to become **comfortable with back end development using Node.js**.  
Each project represents a practical example of building **modular microservices** and using APIs efficiently.
